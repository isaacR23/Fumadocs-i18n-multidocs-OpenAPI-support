title: Sign Up Restriction Announcement
description: Important update regarding our sign-up process and security measures
---

## Important Notice

After careful consideration and in response to ongoing security challenges, we have made the difficult decision to restrict our sign-up process exclusively to Google accounts. This change is necessary to protect our platform and ensure a better experience for legitimate users.

## Why This Change Was Necessary

We have implemented this restriction due to several concerning patterns that have emerged over recent months:

- **Abusive use of our free plan** - Multiple users exploiting our generous free tier beyond intended usage
- **Security measure bypass attempts** - Repeated efforts to circumvent our authentication and verification systems
- **Anonymous account abuse** - Spikes in traffic from accounts with no verifiable identity

These activities not only compromise our platform's security but also negatively impact the experience of legitimate users who rely on our services.

## How to Start Your Trial

To begin your trial, you must register using a Google account (Gmail). If you encounter any issues during signup, please visit [docs.landinganalytics.com/help](https://docs.landinganalytics.com/help) for assistance.

If you accidentally signed up with a non-Google account, you can still access a demo dashboard to explore the user interface and experience the platform. However, to properly start your trial, we recommend either:

- Delete your previous unapproved account, or
- Log out and sign up again with a Google email address

You can find all the necessary account management links at [apps.landinganalytics.com/demo](https://apps.landinganalytics.com/demo), located below the "Demo App" title. There you'll find direct links to delete accounts, sign out, and sign up again.

We're constantly improving our platform to better serve your needs. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any suggestions or feedback.
