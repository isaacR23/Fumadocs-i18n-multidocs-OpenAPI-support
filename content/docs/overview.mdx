## What is Landing Analytics?

Most startups fail. The ones that succeed often do so by accident. But it doesn't have to be this way.

We are a modern analytics platform designed to quickly detect, assess, and improve the retention of your landing page visitors.

Most platforms focus on operational metrics—such as the number of app opens, ride shares, or searches performed. But those are KPIs, not sales metrics.

Landing Analytics began as an internal tool to ingest events and surface potential purchase intent. We decided to make this tool available to the market.

## How It Works

Our platform works by adding a lightweight tracking script to your landing page. This script sends anonymous usage data to our servers, where it's processed, analyzed, and displayed on our intuitive dashboard.

### Getting started is simple:

1. **Sign up** for a free account
2. **Create a new project** in your dashboard
3. **Copy the JavaScript snippet** provided
4. **Paste it into your HTML page**
5. **That's it!** You're now ready to start collecting insights
