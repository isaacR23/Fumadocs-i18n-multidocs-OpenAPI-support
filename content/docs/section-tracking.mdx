## Overview

Section tracking gives you insights into how visitors engage with different parts of your website. See exactly how much time users spend on each section and understand visitor frequency patterns to optimize your saturation strategy.

### FAQ

**What can I track?**
Track time spent on each section, visitor frequency (how many times users return), scroll depth, and section engagement patterns.

**How does it help with saturation?**
Understanding how many times visitors reach your landing page (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th+ visits) helps you develop effective saturation-driven marketing strategies.

**Is this real-time data?**
Yes, you can see real-time section tracking data and visitor frequency metrics in your dashboard.

## Section Metrics

- **Time on Section:** How long visitors spend on each section
- **Section Visibility:** How many visitors actually see each section
- **Scroll Depth:** How far down the page visitors scroll
- **Engagement Rate:** Percentage of visitors who interact with each section
- **Bounce Rate by Section:** Which sections cause visitors to leave

## Visitor Frequency Analysis

Understand how often visitors return to your landing page:

- **First-time Visitors:** New users seeing your page for the first time
- **Returning Visitors:** Users who have visited 2, 3, or 4+ times
- **Frequency Distribution:** See the breakdown of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th+ visits

## Dashboard Reset & Experiment Management

Effective experimentation requires disciplined measurement periods and clear evaluation goals. Our dashboard reset feature ensures you can maintain clean, comparable data sets for accurate analysis.

### How Dashboard Reset Works

The dashboard automatically resets at regular intervals to provide fresh data sets for period-over-period analysis. This ensures you can accurately evaluate the impact of your content changes and section optimizations.

**Reset Benefits:**
- Clean data sets for comparison
- Accurate period-over-period analysis
- Eliminates data contamination
- Maintains experiment integrity

**Data Preservation:**
- No metrics are permanently lost
- Full data export available anytime
- Historical analysis preserved
- Configurable reset intervals

### What Dashboard Reset Enables:

- **Content Impact Evaluation:** Measure how specific content changes affect your landing page performance
- **Strategy Consistency Measurement:** Compare different marketing strategies across clean time periods
- **Traffic Pattern Analysis:** Identify temporal patterns and seasonal variations in your traffic
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Establish clear benchmarks for content and section performance
- **Experiment Validation:** Ensure your A/B tests and optimizations are based on reliable data

> **ℹ️ Important Notes:**
> 
> - Dashboard reset is an automatic feature that cannot be deactivated
> - You can request complete data exports at any time
> - Reset intervals are configurable (max 2 years)
> - Historical data is preserved for long-term analysis

> **📊 Accessing Historical Data:**
> 
> Key metrics are still available at the A/B testing section. To see them, navigate to **A/B Testing (labeled 'A/B' in the top menu)** and scroll to the bottom of the page where the information is available at all times.
> 
> We are currently working on new options for data egress for developers to provide even better access to historical analytics data.
