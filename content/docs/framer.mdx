## Embed Component Setup

Follow these steps to add Landing Analytics to your Framer project:

1. Go to the search components section
2. Find and select the "Embed" component
3. Insert the component into your page
4. Locate the embed section in the right bottom column of the component properties
5. Select "HTML" as the embed type
6. Copy and paste the following code:

```html
<a title='Web Analytics For Your Landing Page' href='https://docs.landinganalytics.com/en/docs/legal/privacy-policy'> <img src='https://29vttzhyyw.ufs.sh/f/s54LtHZ2i7LYy6qTZEOuQ5i3ZfR6nrPj1lAwzL9qhT4xycpO' alt='Landing' /> </a>
<script>window.LANDING_ANALYTICS_PUBLIC_TOKEN = '${user_account_token}';</script>
<script>window.LANDING_ANALYTICS_SITE_ID = '${route.params.project_id}';</script>
<script>window.LANDING_ANALYTICS_DNT = '${domainSettings.collectDNT}';</script>
<script type='module' src='https://unpkg.com/@landinganalytics-lib/tracker-framer' async></script>
```

## Important Notes

> **Important:**
> 
> - You can only set up one script tag per embed component. Make sure to combine all the necessary code in a single script tag if needed.
> - **A/B Testing Not Available**: Framer integration currently does not support A/B testing functionality.
> - The script must include `type='module'` for proper ES module loading.

## Security Best Practices

- Disable CORS to ensure proper endpoint communication
- Consider implementing Cloudflare Turnstile or Google reCAPTCHA to prevent malicious traffic
- Keep your Public Token key secure and never share it publicly

## Getting Your Public Token

To find your Public Token:

1. Go to the projects dashboard
2. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner
3. Select "Tokens"
