## Why Manual Traffic Flagging Matters

While automated tracking captures general metrics, manual traffic flagging gives you granular control over what content you want to analyze. This approach is essential for:

- **Precise Campaign Tracking:** Flag specific marketing campaigns, product launches, or seasonal promotions
- **Content Performance Analysis:** Identify which specific pieces of content drive the most engagement
- **Event Correlation:** Connect traffic spikes to real-world events, social media posts, or external factors
- **ROI Measurement:** Track the direct impact of specific marketing activities on your conversion rates

Manual flagging transforms raw traffic data into actionable business intelligence, helping you make data-driven decisions about your marketing strategy.

## Placing Flags on a Continuous Timeline

Landing Analytics provides an intuitive timeline interface where you can place flags at any point in your traffic history:

```javascript
// Example: Flag a marketing campaign
window.trackEvent('campaign_flag', {
  campaign_name: 'Summer Sale 2024',
  start_date: '2024-06-01',
  end_date: '2024-06-30',
  flag_type: 'marketing_campaign',
  description: 'Major summer sale with 30% discount'
});

// Example: Flag a content update
window.trackEvent('content_flag', {
  content_id: 'hero-section-update',
  flag_type: 'content_change',
  description: 'Updated hero section with new CTA button',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

Each flag creates a visual marker on your timeline, allowing you to:

- Mark the start and end of specific campaigns or events
- Annotate traffic patterns with contextual information
- Create a searchable history of all your marketing activities
- Compare performance before, during, and after flagged periods
