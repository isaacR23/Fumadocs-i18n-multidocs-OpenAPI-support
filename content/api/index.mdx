## Overview
The REST API is designed to facilitate the management of your analytics. You can build custom dashboards, feed artificial intelligence systems with new information, ingest performance metrics into your own systems - the possibilities are unlimited.

</Step>
</Steps>

This is the bearer token you'll use to interact with the different REST endpoints.

## Important: Public Ingestion Token

The public ingestion token is separate from your REST API key. The public token is used specifically for ingesting events into your account (for example, with the JavaScript tracker) and is shared across all your projects. The REST API key, on the other hand, is unique to each project and is used to authenticate requests to the REST API endpoints as described above.

**⚠️ Warning:** If you regenerate this public ingestion token, the API key for ALL your projects will change.
